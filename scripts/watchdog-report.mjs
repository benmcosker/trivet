 * Decide whether the weekly health check has gone missing.

 * reach, silently, either way. So the only evidence is an absence, and absence
 * has to be looked for on purpose by something else.
 *
 * Split from watchdog-check.mjs on the same grounds as health-report.mjs: the
 * judgement lives here where a test can reach it without a network.
