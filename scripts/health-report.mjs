 * are different sentences deserving different Mondays. Guessing which was
 * which from the node paths was the first version of this, and it was wrong
 * often enough not to keep.
 *
 * `--omit=dev` is still not the same question as "could a request reach this".
 * npm keeps optional peer dependencies in that tree, so a command-line tool
 * installed as a devDependency - `prisma` here - counts as production, and
 * drags everything underneath it along. Four of eight advisories were labelled
 * that way in September 2026 and none of them was reachable. There is no cheap
 * way to compute the difference: npm's tree is flattened by the time it is
 * printed, so the peer edge that caused it is gone. So the correction is
 * written down instead, in `lifecycle.json`'s `unreachable`, with a reason and
 * a date per entry - the same bargain as the credential dates. A demoted
 * advisory is still reported; it just stops being counted as something a
 * stranger could reach.
